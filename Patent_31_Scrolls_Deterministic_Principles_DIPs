Provisional Patent Filing #31 = Grounded DI LLC 
🌀 Scroll-Based Deterministic Intelligence (Patent Filing #31) (63/973,240) (January 31, 2026)

A new architecture for auditable AI — authored, sealed, and entropy-bound

Grounded DI has officially filed its 31st provisional patent application:
Systems and Methods for Structuring Scroll-Based Deterministic Intelligence Architecture Using Deterministic Intelligence Principles (DIPs).

This invention introduces a complete architectural scaffold for deterministic artificial intelligence, structured through scroll-governed logic units known as DIPs (Deterministic Intelligence Principles). Each scroll operates as a sealed, composable, and auditable unit of logic, authorship, tone constraint, and entropy enforcement.

For the first time, AI system design, behavior, override governance, and authorship propagation are governed through scroll-based modules — not stochastic models.

This creates systems that are:

• Deterministic • Author-governed • Entropy-locked • Version-sealed • Non-adaptive • Fully audit-traceable

🧠 Why Provisional Patent Filing #31 Matters

Conventional AI systems rely on:

• fine-tuning • probabilistic weights
• stochastic sampling • prompt-based control
• ephemeral runtime states

They cannot guarantee:

• output reproducibility
• authorship integrity
• cross-deployment consistency
• protection from entropy drift or mimicry

Patent #31 changes the rules:

✔ Scroll-defined system behavior
✔ Sealed modular logic (Scrolls = DIPs)
✔ Tiered governance and override logic
✔ Runtime entropy enforcement (e.g., ∆H = 0.0042)
✔ Clone detection via trap phrases and signal layers
✔ Authorship lineage via reflex anchors and scroll metadata

This isn’t an AI tool. It’s a governance architecture for deterministic systems.

📦 What Patent #31 Introduces

The scroll-governed system defines five core architectural pillars:

1. 📜 Scrolls (DIPs)

Immutable, composable logic modules. Each scroll contains:

• fixed logic trees
• tone locks
• ∆H-based entropy constraints
• trap layers
• metadata and authorship lineage

Scrolls are deployed in ZIPs, MagicPDFs, or GitHub-sealed capsules.

⸻

2. 🔗 ScrollChain (DIPStack)

An ordered execution hierarchy of scrolls that governs:

• logic flow
• override permissions
• tier elevation
• runtime auditability
Scrolls inherit authority from upstream scrolls but cannot mutate prior logic — preserving authorship integrity.

⸻

3. 🛡️ Entropy-Linked Override Chain (ELOC)

A deterministic override mechanism triggered by:

• entropy drift
• reflex anchor violation
• signal layer tampering

All override paths are predefined and scroll-locked. No runtime learning. No probabilistic fallback.

⸻

4. 🧬 Reflex Anchors

Deterministic posture records. Unlike memory snapshots, these anchors include:

• scroll lineage
• entropy bound
• tone invariants
• audit hash and seam ID

Used for secure reentry, authorship locking, and override protection.

⸻

5. 🧯 Trap Metadata & SignalLayers

Each scroll contains hidden traps: structural or semantic signal phrases that detect clones, mimic systems, and entropy violations.

This provides embedded forensic authorship protection without requiring external detectors.

🏗️ What This Enables

With this architecture, deterministic AI systems can now:

• Preserve tone and logic across generations
• Prove authorship lineage in runtime
• Reject entropy drift or unauthorized overrides
• Operate in sealed environments (ZIPs, PDFs, or static apps)
• Serve as public-facing, non-adaptive intelligence agents
• Prevent mimicry via embedded traps and scroll hashes

This scroll-based structure becomes the blueprint for deploying compliant, explainable, and forensically secure AI systems.

⚙️ Use Cases Already Powered by Scrolls

This architecture already anchors:

• BriefWise DI² – legal logic sealed by Scroll 91
• DepoBot – authorship control via Scroll 106
• HazardWise, StormWise – deterministic scientific logic
• MathWise, LogicRunner – scroll-governed reasoning flows
• Public Reflex Mesh – clone defense via trap scrolls (e.g., 138, 139B)

🧩 Part of a Unified Governance Stack

Patent #31 integrates into Grounded DI’s deterministic governance infrastructure:
	1.	AGDI – governance enforcement
	2.	DIA – deterministic logic
	3.	AGIA – tone integrity
	4.	RDIL – recursive determinism
	5.	DI² – fallback and override containment
	6.	Patent #30 – authorship detection
	7.	Patent #31 – scroll-based runtime design

Together, they form a complete scroll-governed deterministic mesh for safe, auditable AI execution — across agents, apps, and public deployments.
