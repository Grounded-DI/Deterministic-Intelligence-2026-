**Grounded DI LLC Files Patent #30:**

**Deterministic AI-Generated Text Detection (January 29, 2026) (63/970,433)**
A structural breakthrough in authorship integrity and deterministic auditability

Grounded DI has officially filed its 30th patent application:
Systems and Methods for Deterministic Detection of AI-Generated Text in Principle-Governed Deterministic Intelligence Architectures.

This invention establishes the world’s first deterministic authorship detector — an auditable, version-locked, scroll-governed system capable of identifying AI-generated text without machine learning, sampling, probability, embeddings, or statistical inference.

For the first time, detection is:

• Deterministic
• Non-probabilistic
• Governance-bound
• Memoryless
• Model-agnostic
• Fully audit-traceable

This invention closes the “detection gap” left by statistical AI tools, providing a forensic-grade, court-admissible, and enterprise-safe method for verifying authorship across any domain.

🧠 Why Patent #30 Matters

Conventional AI-text detectors rely on:

• classifier models
• token-pattern heuristics
• sampling-based scoring
• embeddings, perplexity, or burstiness
• statistical drift across model updates
• unreproducible confidence thresholds

These systems cannot guarantee:

• stable authorship judgments
• reproducible results
• version-locked outputs
• drift immunity
• regulatory or forensic reliability

Patent #30 introduces a radically different paradigm:

✔ A deterministic detection pipeline

✔ Fixed metrics, sealed schemas, and scroll-defined invariants

✔ Fully reproducible outputs for identical inputs

✔ A non-overridable gate that enforces deterministic constraints

✔ A sealed audit capsule for every classification event

This is the first detection system engineered not as a model —
but as a governance engine.

🔒 What Patent #30 Enables

The patented system introduces four architectural breakthroughs:

1. A deterministic multi-metric engine

A fixed metric suite (SLB, WSV, STC, RNP, DMD, etc.)
executed identically across all environments.

2. A non-overridable scroll-governed gate

Fallback cannot be bypassed.
No retries.
No sampling.
No human “override.”
Only deterministic pass/fail states.

3. A sealed audit capsule

Every detection event generates a cryptographically stable record:

• input hash
• metric schema ID
• normalized scores
• gate flags
• final determination
• runtime lineage

This creates perfect forensic traceability.

4. A closed taxonomy

Outputs are version-locked:

• HUMAN
• AI-GENERATED
• MIXED
• DEFORMED
• INDETERMINATE (governance-bound)

No gradients.
No confidence scores.
No drift.

🌐 Why Enterprises Care

Organizations increasingly need:

• reliable authorship verification
• protection from fraud, impersonation, and AI-generated deception
• repeatable detection results
• compliance-grade audit logs
• tools that do not degrade as models evolve

Probabilistic detectors break under version changes.
Deterministic detectors do not.

Patent #30 provides:

✔ drift-immune authorship detection
✔ reproducible results across years
✔ sealed analytic pipelines
✔ audit capsules for litigation, regulation, and provenance
✔ independence from model internals or training data
✔ a governance-first alternative to ML-based detection

This is a foundational requirement for:

• schools and universities
• courts and law enforcement
• publishers and journalists
• regulatory agencies
• enterprise compliance teams
• any domain requiring verifiable authorship

🏛️ Part of a Larger Deterministic Framework

Patent #30 integrates seamlessly with the full deterministic stack:
	1.	AGDI — Deterministic governance
	2.	DIA — Deterministic logic
	3.	AGIA — Deterministic tone
	4.	RDIL — Deterministic recursion
	5.	DI² — Deterministic fallback
	6.	Patent #30 — Deterministic authorship verification

Together, they form a unified containment mesh where:

• reasoning is deterministic
• tone is deterministic
• recursion is deterministic
• fallback is deterministic
• AND NOW detection is deterministic

This establishes Grounded DI as the first architecture with complete end-to-end determinism, from input to output to authorship verification.
